# RedRiver_ForecastValue

This repository contains the code and results used to generate Figures 2, 4-8 and S1-S4 of Quinn et al. (In Review):

Quinn, J.D., Reed, P.M., Giuliani, M., and Castelletti, A. (In Review). Assessing how the value of forecast information for multi-objective reservoir operations changes under different flood protection constraints. 

Figure 1 was adapted manually from Figure 2 in [Giuliani et al. (2015)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015WR017044) using Adobe Illustrator.

Figure 3 is the same as Figure 2 from [Quinn et al. (2017)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017WR020524/full), and the code used to make it can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/julianneq/RedRiver_RivalFramings.

The data for several figures is too large to share over Github, but can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C6Srhp91xOcMjZvPp5Ngy-rGW2mFamFk?usp=drive_link). Pasting the files within `RedRiver_ForecastValue/baseline_100`, `RedRiver_ForecastValue/baseline_500`, `RedRiver_ForecastValue/HydroInfo_100` and `RedRiver_ForecastValue/HydroInfo_500` of that Google Drive folder to the corresponding folders of this repository will enable all figures to be plotted.

The processing of the Pareto sets and performance of the sensitivity analysis follows the steps in processingSteps.txt in this folder. The figures in the paper can be made using the scripts in the PaperFigures directory.
